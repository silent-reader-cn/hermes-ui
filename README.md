## Highlights

- **Bundled WebUI Sidecar (Windows)** — the installer ships a self-contained WebUI backend with an embedded Python 3.11 runtime: no pre-installed Python, Git, or compilers required. One click to start & connect, Clash-Verge style.
- **Smart interpreter reuse** — on startup the app detects an existing Hermes Agent installation and reuses its virtualenv (full agent dependencies, chat works out of the box). Without one, the bundled embedded Python still serves read-only session history.
- **Streaming chat** — SSE streaming with Markdown + code blocks, reasoning and tool-call cards, steer and stop mid-turn, model picker, per-session drafts.
- **Sessions** — debounced search, pin / archive / branch / delete, sectioned list (pinned / today / earlier), offline cache.
- **Tasks (cron)** — create, edit, enable/disable, trigger manually, inspect output, run-status badges.
- **Skills & Memory** — browse and filter skills; memory panel with editing and write-back.
- **Workspace & Git** — browse/upload/download workspace files; branch switching, status, diffs, commit, fetch / pull / push.
- **Kanban** — boards and cards with cross-column drag & drop.
- **Insights** — session / message / token / cost metrics, per-model breakdown, 14-day token chart.
- **Notifications** — Android background turn-completion notifications with deep-link back to the conversation.
- **Desktop polish** — tray icon, global hotkeys, window-state memory, launch-on-login (Windows).
- **Bilingual UI** — English / 简体中文 / follow system.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Grab the latest installer (`*.exe`) from the [Releases](https://github.com/silent-reader-cn/hermes-ui/releases) page and run it.
2. Launch **Hermes UI**. On the onboarding screen pick **Built-in service** → **Start & Connect**. That's it — the WebUI backend starts automatically.

Chat requires a [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs) installation. If none is detected, the onboarding screen shows a card linking to the install guide; without it the app still works in read-only mode (session history), and attempting to chat will tell you what's missing.

### Android

Download the `*-arm64.apk` from the [Releases](https://github.com/silent-reader-cn/hermes-ui/releases) page (Android 7.0+) and connect it to your Hermes server on the network.

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silent-reader-cn/hermes-ui.git
cd hermes-ui
flutter pub get

# Windows desktop
flutter run -d windows

# Android device / emulator
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

Requirements: Flutter 3.47+ (stable), JDK 17 + Android SDK 36 for Android builds, Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 (C++ desktop workload) for Windows builds.

## Connecting to a server

Two connection modes, configured on the onboarding screen or in Settings → Servers:

| Mode | When to use | What you need |
|---|---|---|
| **Built-in service** (Windows) | You just installed the app on the same machine that runs Hermes | Nothing — the app starts and connects to its own bundled WebUI automatically |
| **Remote server** | You already run hermes-webui (or the built-in sidecar) elsewhere — a home server, VPS, or your PC | Host, port, and password (or username + password / API key) |

Multiple server profiles are supported with one-tap switching. Credentials are stored in the system secure storage.

The API contract is aligned with **[nesquena/hermes-webui](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui)** (MIT), the community Hermes WebUI.
